A very good morning to everyone!
This is Akshat Jain, a 3rd year student pursuing CSE at IIT Patna. I am really excited to begin this journey with Goldman Sachs and learn a lot of new things and network with a lot of new people. Really looking forward to the internship experience!
Thank You



Good afternoon ma'am.
I am selected for the summer internship in Goldman Sachs, but till now I haven't been contacted by my mentor. Today at the end of the zoom meeting I was told that we are supposed to contact our mentors. So ma'am, could you please resolve this issue as I am stuck here not knowing what to do. 

Thank you
